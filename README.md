# College Sports Participation Analysis using EDA

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sports participation among college students using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
The aim is to understand department-wise and sport-wise participation trends and analyze the relationship between sports activities and student fitness levels.

This project is completed independently as part of the **Minor-I Project** for the **AI/ML course (Semester 3)** at **Rungta College of Engineering & Technology, Bhilai**.

##  Objectives
- To analyze overall sports participation in college
- To study department-wise sports participation trends
- To identify the most popular sports among students
- To analyze the correlation between sports activity and fitness score
- To visualize insights using graphs and charts

##  Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is a **self-created CSV file** containing sports participation data of students.

### Dataset Attributes:
- Student_ID
- Department
- Year
- Gender
- Sport
- Weekly_Hours
